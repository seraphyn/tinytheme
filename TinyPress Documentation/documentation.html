		<p>Shortcodes are the most important part in our theme as it gives the content a better look and feel, there's 8 shortcodes in TinyPress theme:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>First, go to WordPress editor by adding a new page or post</li>
			<li>in your editor you will see the following icons, I'm going to demonstrtae each one of them by order from left to right</li>
			<li>The 1st icon is to place a YouTube video, in the id all you need to do is inserting your video id you may leave other calues like width and height as it's to make it viewable on all devices</li>
			<li>The 2nd and the 3rd icons are done the same way you have done YouTube video</li>
			<li>The 4th icon is to add a button in your post, in class you choose button size for example class="big or small", link and target in target field you can leave it blank if you want the link to open in the same page or target="_blank"  if you want it to open in a new tab</li>
			<li>The 5th icon is to insert a dropcap Letter in the beginning of your post</li>
			<li>The 6th icon is used to add toggle option or accordion, if you want it accordion, you just type accordion on type or leave blank if not, then you insert your list of toggles inside it like this [toggles type="accordion"][toggle title="1-title"]content[/toggle][toggle title="2-title"]content[/toggle][/toggle] </li>
			<li>7th icon is to add an image with rounded or bordered style, if you want the image to align right, left or center type align="right", in some cases you may want to add image next to paragraph in this case you type float="right, left ot center", you will be also allowed to add image caption</li>
			<li>You can sperate between content using [linebreak /] shortcode</li>
			<li>The last icon is used to insert a paragrapgh between quotes which is very simple</li>
